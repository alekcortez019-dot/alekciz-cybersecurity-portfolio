#  Vulnerability Scanning & Assessment

This section includes network vulnerability scans, findings analysis, and remediation recommendations performed using tools such as Nessus, Nmap, and OpenVAS in a simulated enterprise environment.

##  Objectives
- Identify vulnerabilities across hosts and services  
- Analyze CVSS scoring and risk levels  
- Perform network discovery using Nmap  
- Document high risk findings with remediation steps  
- Understand enterprise vulnerability management workflows  

##  Contents
- **nessus-scan-results.md** – sample Nessus report summaries  
- **nmap-discovery.md** – network scanning results and host enumeration  
- **high-risk-findings.md** – breakdown of critical vulnerabilities  
- **remediation-plan.md** – recommended fixes for identified issues  
- **screenshots/** – screenshots of scans and reports  

##  Nmap Scan Example

**Command Used:****Summary of Findings:**
- Multiple hosts running outdated SSH versions  
- Web server discovered with directory listing enabled  
- SMB shares exposed without authentication  
- Open ports: 22, 80, 139, 445, 3389  

##  Nessus Scan Example

**Critical Findings:**
- **CVE-2023-1234:** Remote Code Execution vulnerability in outdated service  
- **CVE-2022-3456:** Weak TLS configuration  
- **CVE-2021-41773:** Path traversal vulnerability in Apache  

**Risk Breakdown:**
- Critical: 3  
- High: 6  
- Medium: 12  
- Low: 14  

## Sample Remediation Plan

**1. Patch outdated services immediately**  
Affected hosts should be upgraded to the latest stable versions.

**2. Enforce strong TLS configuration**  
Disable weak ciphers and enable TLS 1.2 or higher.

**3. Harden the web server**  
Disable directory listing, restrict file permissions, and enable WAF.

**4. Restrict SMB access**  
Disable anonymous access and enforce authentication.
